WHAT IS METHODS?

A method in Java is a block of code that performs a specific task. It is like 
a function in other programming languages and is used to define the behavior of an object.
Methods can take inputs (parameters), perform actions, and optionally return a result.


A method is a set of instructions grouped together to perform a specific
action or operation in a Java program.

Key Features of Methods
Code Reusability: Methods can be called multiple times, reducing redundancy.
Modularity: They help break down complex programs into smaller, manageable pieces.
Encapsulation: Methods encapsulate behavior within a class, hiding implementation details from other classes.
Parameters and Return Values: Methods can accept inputs (parameters) and return outputs (return values).


Structure of a Method
A Java method has the following parts:

Method Signature: Specifies the name, return type, and parameters.
Method Body: Contains the block of code that defines the method's behavior.

Parts of a Method
Modifier: Defines the access level (e.g., public, private, protected).
Return Type: Specifies the type of value the method returns (void if it doesn't return anything).
Method Name: A unique name that identifies the method.
Parameters: Input values passed to the method (enclosed in parentheses).
Method Body: The code block that executes when the method is called.
Return Statement: Returns a value from the method (only if the return type is not void).
