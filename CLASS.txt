WHAT IS CLASS?
A class in Java is user-defined blueprint or prototype that serves as a template for creating objects.
It encapsulates data (fields) and methods (functions) that operate on the data, 
enabling modular and reusable code in object-oriented programming.

Key Features of a Java Class

Fields: Variables that hold the state or attributes of an object.

Methods: Functions that define the behavior of the objects created from the class.

Constructors: Special methods used to initialize objects.

Modifiers: Keywords like public, private, and protected that define the visibility or scope of the class, fields, and methods.

Key Features of a Class:
Encapsulation: Classes group data and methods together, keeping them organized and secure.

Reusability: Classes can be reused to create multiple objects with similar properties and behaviors.

Modularity: Classes help divide a program into smaller, manageable units.

Inheritance: A class can inherit properties and methods from another class.

Abstraction: Classes allow hiding the implementation details from users.

Advantages of Classes
Modular Code: Classes divide programs into smaller, manageable pieces.
Reusability: A class can be reused to create multiple objects.
Scalability: Easy to add new features by extending or modifying existing classes.
Security: Encapsulation helps protect sensitive data.


Key Points to Remember
A class is a blueprint for objects.
Objects are instances of a class.
Use fields for data storage and methods for behavior.
Constructors are special methods for initializing objects.
Classes are the building blocks of object-oriented programming in Java.
