WHAT IS FACTOR
a number which is divisrable by any number leaving reminder zero.

Factors are the numbers you can multiply together to get another number. 
In programming, a factor of a number is any number that divides it evenly, 
leaving no remainder.


The factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12, because:
1×12=12
2×6=12
3×4=12.

Key Properties of Factors
Divisibility: A factor divides the number completely without a remainder.
Finite Number: A number has a finite number of factors.
Smallest Factor: The smallest factor of any number is 1.
Largest Factor: The largest factor of a number is the number itself.
Pairs of Factors: Factors always appear in pairs.

Types of Factors
Prime Factors:

Factors that are prime numbers.
Example: Prime factors of 12 are 2 and 3 (since 
2×2×3=12(2×2×3=12).

Common Factors:
Factors that are common between two or more numbers.
Example: Common factors of 12 and 18 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.

Highest Common Factor (HCF):
The largest factor common to two or more numbers.
Example: HCF of 12 and 18 is 6.

Prime Factorization
Prime factorization is breaking down a number into its prime factors.

Steps:

Start dividing the number by the smallest prime number (2, 3, 5, etc.).
Continue dividing the quotient(bhaag) by prime numbers until the quotient becomes 1.
Example: Find the prime factorization of 24:
24÷2=12
12÷2=6
6÷2=3
3÷3=1

Prime factors: 
2×2×2×3

Real-Life Applications of Factors
Divisors: Used in dividing objects or quantities into equal parts.
Simplifying Fractions: Factors help reduce fractions to their simplest form.
Finding HCF and LCM: Useful in solving problems related to ratios, proportions, and schedules.
Number Theory: Factors are essential in cryptography and prime number studies.

Key Points to Remember
1 is a factor of every number.
Every number is a factor of itself.
Factors are always less than or equal to the number.
Prime numbers have exactly two factors: 1 and the number itself.
Composite numbers have more than two factors.
